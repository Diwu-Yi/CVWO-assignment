# CVWO-assignment


My very first attempt to build something (A task manager).

Unfortunately , this project failed due to hardware limitations . I was using a Windows 8 computer and I failed to install a newer version of Ruby on Rails , which was the required language.

I learnt from this project that it is important to keep your operating system up-to-date.
